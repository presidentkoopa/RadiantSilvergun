// =====================================================================
// RS_AttackProfile / RS_AttackSlot -- the attack-assembly bricks.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// One AttackProfile describes ONE way a weapon attacks: what leaves the
// barrel, what it costs, its own shot shape, its own sound. Nothing in
// it is hardcoded to a specific weapon -- it's a reference bundle, so
// the same profile can sit on several weapons, and a weapon can carry
// several different ones.
//
// An AttackSlot is an ORDERED LIST of profiles plus a cursor. Firing the
// slot fires the profile at the cursor, then advances one step, wrapping
// at the end. That single mechanism covers everything:
//
//   list of 1                -> a normal weapon. Cursor never visibly
//                               moves; looks like no cycling at all.
//   list of [A, A, B]        -> "every third shot is B"
//   list of [A, B]           -> "alternates A and B"
//
// A weapon has two slots -- Primary (main trigger) and Secondary
// (alt-fire). They are fully independent: different profiles, different
// ammo, different everything. Nothing is shared between them.
//
// WHY IT'S SHAPED THIS WAY: GunBonsai upgrades write into this at two
// altitudes, and both are one-line operations on the structures below:
//   * grow the list   -> AppendProfile() / InsertProfile()  ("your
//                        revolver now fires a plasma bolt every 3rd shot")
//   * swap an entry   -> ReplaceProfile()                   ("your
//                        alt-fire is now something else entirely")
// The upgrade-card sentence and the data structure are the same thing
// described two ways.
//
// The weapon's OWN rolled stats (Tier, Condition, DamagePerShot,
// Accuracy, CritChance, Velocity) are NOT duplicated per profile. They
// stay on RS_Weapon and modulate whatever profile just fired -- a
// Prototype-tier gun's plasma entry hits harder than a Basic-tier gun's
// plasma entry, and the profile never needs to know that happened.
// =====================================================================

// Which firing path a profile uses. Lives on the individual profile, not
// on the weapon, so one weapon can rotate through wildly different attack
// types without any of them being a special case.
const RS_ATK_BULLET  = 0;   // volley of travelling rounds (RS_BallisticFired)

// --- Monster-side modes ---------------------------------------------
// Monsters need verbs weapons don't have. Added to the SAME enum rather
// than forked into a parallel type because RS_AttackProfile.Clone()
// hardcodes new("RS_AttackProfile") and PadTo() calls it -- a subclass
// would silently slice every time an upgrade padded a rotation. The
// weapon dispatch ignores modes it doesn't handle, so weapons are
// unaffected by these existing.
// WHICH BEAT AN ATTACK BELONGS TO. Most attacks fire from Missile; CHP
// fires plenty from elsewhere and those were previously undescribable.
// Comparison-chain friendly ints, never a static const array -- that form
// does not resolve reliably on this engine build (CLAUDE.md).
