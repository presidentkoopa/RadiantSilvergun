// =====================================================================
// RS_MonsterMaster -- the monster-side parallel of RS_Weapon.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Owns three things and nothing else:
//
//   TIER     numeric 00..12 (+ EX via TierLocked). Runtime-safe,
//            idempotent, re-callable mid-fight.
//   BODY     which sprite (and which TRNSLATE colour) this monster
//            wears at this tier, as DATA -- two space-delimited
//            strings in ladder order.
//   ATTACKS  an RS_AttackSlot per tier (RS_AttackProfile.zs, same
//            structure the guns use).
//
// Content-free. No monster behaviour lives here.
//
// WHY THE BODY STRING: the previous port wrote Spawn/See/Pain/Death out
// once per tier -- thirteen near-identical blocks whose only difference
// was a four-letter sprite name. Measured across all 19 family files
// that was about three quarters of every file. Here the base owns one
// set of states and the family supplies thirteen sprite names on one
// line. A family that genuinely needs a bespoke tier still overrides
// the state outright; the table is the default, not a cage.
//
// The sprite and colour are applied on TIER CHANGE, not on state entry.
// A monster's body doesn't change because it took a step.
//
// It used to also declare three empty per-family base classes
// (RS_HumanMonster, RS_DemonBase, RS_KnightBase). They were removed on
// 2026-08-04 -- see the note at the bottom of this file for why, and for
// what to do instead if family grouping is ever actually wanted.

	// multipliers below apply instead, recomputed from the actor's
	// Defaults. Writing the real number is clearer and cannot drift, so
