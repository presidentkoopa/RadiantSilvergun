// =====================================================================
// RS_MonsterCommands -- CH/CHP's pack-buff ACS, rebuilt in ZScript.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. CH and CHP express several monster mechanics as
// an Inventory token whose entire DECORATE body is one
// ACS_NamedExecuteAlways(...) call. The monster import read those empty
// bodies and dropped the tokens on the reasoning that "porting them
// would import nothing." The body is empty BECAUSE the behaviour lives
// in the ACS script -- so dropping the token dropped the mechanic, and
// because the DECORATE really does look empty the loss was invisible at
// every call site. See docs/rs_19_acs_inventory.txt for the full audit.
//
// This file rebuilds the PACK BUFF family: the four scripts a "brown
// tier" leader throws at its neighbours to make the pack genuinely
// harder. Sources read verbatim from CH/source/CHSett.acs and
// CHP/source/CHSett2.acs (identical bodies -- CHP is a copy of CH).
//
//   CH script          property        value      duration  fast  thrust
//   PESPEED            APROP_SPEED     normal+10   600t     yes   no
//   BrownImpCommand    APROP_SPEED     normal+10   180t     yes   yes
//   BrownVileCommand   APROP_DamageFac 0.65        300t     no    yes
//   BrownMindCommand   APROP_DamageFac 0.50        300t     yes   yes
//
// APROP_DamageFactor scales damage RECEIVED, so the last two are damage
// RESISTANCE auras (0.50 = takes half), not damage buffs.
//
// THREE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCES FROM CH, each fixing a bug in the
// original rather than reproducing it:
//
//  1. CH's re-entrancy guard does not work. Every one of these scripts
//     opens `int Nope;` as a SCRIPT-LOCAL, which is zero-initialised on
//     every invocation, so the `if (Nope == 0)` test always passes. Two
//     overlapping casts therefore both read the ALREADY-BUFFED value as
//     `Normal` and the monster's base speed permanently drifts upward.
//     A Powerup cannot do this: InitEffect runs once on attach, the
//     saved value is captured once, and a re-cast renews the timer
//     instead of re-reading. This is why the rebuild is a Powerup and
//     not a Thinker imitating the script.
//
//  2. CH clears ALWAYSFAST unconditionally when the buff ends, so a
//     monster that was NATIVELY ALWAYSFAST loses the flag permanently
//     the first time it is buffed. We track whether WE set it and only
//     clear it if we did.
//
//  3. CH restores the property to a captured absolute. If the monster's
//     speed legitimately changed during the buff (a tier promotion, say)
//     that change is stomped. We restore by DELTA for speed, so an
//     unrelated change survives.
//
// Boss exemption is CH's, kept exactly: `if (CheckFlag(0,"BOSS"))
// Terminate;`. Bosses refuse these outright.
// =====================================================================

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE JOSTLE. CH follows every *Command with
//   ThrustThing (random(0,255), random(1,12), 0, 0)
//   ThrustThingZ(0, random(1,12), random(0,1), 0)
// which physically flings the recipient in a random direction -- the
// visible "the pack just got shouted at" tell. Scale is APPROXIMATE
// (Hexen's 1/8 and 1/4 unit conventions) and is flavour, not damage, so
// getting it slightly wrong costs feel rather than balance.
//
// NOTE ON SHAPE: this is duplicated as a method on both base classes
// below rather than living once on a shared helper. That is deliberate.
// A static helper on a plain Object has NO precedent in this tree for
// calling random() -- and this repo's history is a list of constructs
// that looked obviously fine and did not resolve (`static const T
// name[]`, `extend class PlayerPawn`, `Damage (random(a,b))` in a
// Default). Powerup descends from Actor, where random() is certainly in
// scope. Six duplicated lines is a cheaper bet than a novel one, and
// RS_PowerPackGuard cannot share a base with RS_PowerPackHaste anyway:
// it must descend from PowerProtection, which is Powerup's own subclass.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// HASTE -- the +10 ADDITIVE speed line (PESPEED, BrownImpCommand).
//
// Additive, not multiplicative, and that is the whole character of it:
// PowerSpeed multiplies, so it would scale with the recipient. CH adds a
// flat +10, which takes a Zombieman from 8 to 18 (+125%) and a
// Cyberdemon from 16 to 26 (+62%). The buff deliberately does more for
// the weak half of the pack. Do NOT "simplify" this to PowerSpeed.

// WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES, once the machinery is stripped: DOUBLE the
// target's speed for 210 tics, then put it back. That is the whole
// mechanic. Everything else in those 45 lines exists to emulate, in ACS,
// what a Powerup gives you for free:
//   * RevSpeedBuff2 / RevSpeedBuff3 are not items, they are BOOLEANS --
//     token inventory used to record "is the buff running".
//   * the NOSKIN actor flag is ALSO abused as a second such boolean,
//     because the first pair could not be made reliable.
//   * every "SetActorProperty(SPEED, Normal / 2)" branch is the UNDO
//     path: `Normal` is read at script entry, so on an already-doubled
//     monster, halving is what restores it. It reads like a penalty and
//     is actually a restore.
//   * `Nope` is a script-local, zero on every entry, so the guard it
//     looks like it provides does not exist -- same defect as the other
//     four scripts in this file.
// A Powerup renews its timer on re-application and runs EndEffect once,
// which is precisely the behaviour all of that was reaching for.
//
// NO BOSS EXEMPTION, deliberately: unlike PESPEED and the *Command
// scripts, BrownRevSPEED2 has no CheckFlag(0,"BOSS") guard. Matched.
